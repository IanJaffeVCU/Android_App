What the To-Do App is going to do.
1. Stores class scheudle and work schedule. Reminds you when class starts.

2. you can enter assignments and difficulty/importance of the assignment.

3. Based on the assignment difficulty and its due date, we will create a schedule that they are welcome to use.

4. All of the schedule planning will be based on 8-8-8 rule (8 hours of sleeping, 8hrs of class and studying and 8hrs of free time to work or do other personal activities).
